# Gacha Game Behavioral Economies

This project investigates **player behavior and monetization patterns** in gacha-style games through a custom-built experimental platform.

## Overview
A **fully functional gacha battle game** in HTML/JavaScript, featuring both summoning mechanics and battle sequences.  
- **Gameplay:** Players summon characters and use them in battle.  
- **Data Collection:** In-game behavior (summon frequency, battle outcomes, spending decisions) is tracked via Google Apps Script and logged for analysis.  
- **Focus:** Capturing how players engage with randomized reward systems and how these behaviors relate to in-game progression and resource management.
